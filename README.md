Portfolio

A 3 page portfolio website for my (future) professional work, with an "About Me," a "Portfolio" and a "Contact" page. The "About Me" doubles as the home page, which I would change if allowed to.

I used only bootstrap components (excluding images obviously) for the formatting and styling. For the portfolio, I listed a handful of my favorite records i've been listening to.
