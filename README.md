Portfolio

A 3 page portfolio website for my (future) professional work, with an "About Me," a "Portfolio" and a "Contact" page. The "About Me" doubles as the home page, which I would change if allowed to.

I used only bootstrap components (excluding images obviously) for the formatting and styling. For the portfolio, I listed a handful of my favorite records i've been listening to.

I'm pretty happy with it overall. two things in particular I couldn't figure out that still bother me:
first: the opacity of the hamburger makes it very hard to see against the water image backgrounds, particularly on index.html. I tried probably a dozen different ways to give it a border, none successful. not sure about that one...
second: the hamburger drops down on small screen sizes. similarly, I could not figure out a way to get it to dropright, but would prefer that as well. possibly because the menu is too wide when expanded, but in that case i'd prefer it go underneath the button as a lower row. oh well.
